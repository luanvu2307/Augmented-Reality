# Augmented-Reality

This is my final project of my Computer Vision subject which follows source code of this guy, here: (https://github.com/juangallostra/augmented-reality)

Camera should be prepared for this project.

I have customized his project to get task achievement of my teacher. Some differences between his project and mine are:

+ object files have their color ( you can customize them by opening with Visual Studio Code).
+ All of input images can be augmented together at the same time.
+ Some functions have been upgraded to get a higher accuracy of object detection.

Models folder includes some object files (file.obj). These files will be augmented when running code.

Image folder contains three input images.
